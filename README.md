# MyReads Project
* My Reads is a book tracking app that help you manage your Book Library
* and mange the state of the books  by dividing the list to three shelves (Currently Reading ,Want to Read , Read )
* to allow moving books from shelf to another also allow the user  to search for a book by using search terms
* and add a book to it's list 
* There are two pages the BookList page displays the three shelves (Currently Reading ,Want to Read , Read ) and The search page will   allow the user to search for books and displays one shelfe (result) from the search.
## Setup instructions 
* install all project dependencies with `npm install` or `yarn install` if you're using `yarn`
* start the development server with `npm start` or `yarn start`
* Now your browser will automatically open a live version of MyReads.
## Important
* The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
